## Install from Github repository

It is currently necessary to install the OpenEntrance dependency as an editable installation.
See [issue](https://github.com/openENTRANCE/openentrance/issues/202)

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/openENTRANCE/openentrance.git@main#egg=openentrance
    pip install git+https://github.com/osemosys/osemosys2iamc@main#egg=osemosys2iamc

## Run the package

    $ osemosys2iamc --help
    osemosys2iamc <inputs_path> <results_path> <config_path> <output_path>

`inputs_path`: Path to a folder of csv files (OSeMOSYS inputs). File names should correspond to OSeMOSYS parameter names.
`results_path`: Path to a folder of csv files (OSeMOSYS results). File names should correspond to OSeMOSYS variable names.
`config_path`: Path to the configuration file (see below)
`output_path`: Path to the .xlsx file you wish to write out

## The IAMC format

The IAMC format was developed by the [Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC)](https://www.iamconsortium.org/)
and is used in many model comparison projects at the global and national level.
It can be used for integrated-assessment models, energy-systems scenarios
and analysis of specific sectors like transport, industry or buildings.

The format is a tabular structure with the columns *model*, *scenario*, *region*,
*variable*, *unit*, and a time domain. Each project defines "codelists"
to be used across modelling teams for comparison and analysis of results.

The most recent high-profile application of the IAMC format is the [AR6 Scenario Explorer](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ar6)
hosting the scenario ensemble supporting the quantitative assessment
in the contribution by Working Group III to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6).

Please refer to the Horizon 2020 project [openENTRANCE](https://github.com/openENTRANCE/openentrance#data-format-structure)
for more information about the format and its usage in that project.

## Writing a configuration file

Write a configuration file in YAML format. A simple configuration file with one result variable looks like this:

    model: OSeMBE v1.0.0
    scenario: DIAG-C400-lin-ResidualFossil
    region: ['Austria']  # select countries to plot summary results
    results:
    - iamc_variable: 'Carbon Capture|Biomass'
      tech_emi: ['(?=^.{2}(BM))^.{4}(CS)']
      emissions: [CO2]
      unit: kt CO2/yr
      transform: abs
    osemosys_param: AnnualTechnologyEmissions

The first section of the configuration file with the keys `model`, `scenario`, and `region` are used to define the metadata for
the IAMC template.

The second section `results:` is where you describe each of the IAMC variables and provide instructions to osemosys2iamc on how
to compute the values.

`iamc_variable` - this should match one of the IAMC variable names
`unit` - provide the units of the OSeMOSYS results
`transform` - only `abs` is currently available. This returns the absolute value of the results
`osemosys_param` - provide the name of the result file from which the script should extract the result data

One or more of the following filter keys. These filter the
results by one or more columns found in OSeMOSYS results.
Following the fitering, the remaining columns except region
 and year are discarded and rows are summed.

`tech_emi` - filter the results by TECHNOLOGY and EMISSION columns using the provide regular expression and an `emissions` entry
`emissions` - a list of emissions to filter the results by the EMISSION column
`fuel` - filter by the FUEL column
`capacity` - filter the TECHNOLOGY column
`primary_technology` - filter the TECHNOLOGY column (can be replaced by `capacity` key)
`excluded_prod_tech` - filter the TECHNOLOGY column (can be replaced by `capacity` key)
`el_prod_technology` - filter the TECHNOLOGY column (can be replaced by `capacity` key)
`demand` - filters by the FUEL column (final energy)

The value for each of these keys is a list of regular expressions. These regular expressions are used to filter the rows of data in the chosen column to those that match the
regular expression.

Writing regular expressions can be tricky, but there are [useful tools](https://regexr.com/) to help.
Below we provide some examples:

`^.{2}(WI)` match rows with any two characters followed by `WI`

`(?=^.{2}(HF))^((?!00).)*$` match rows with `HF` in 3rd and 4th position which do not include `00`

`(?=^.{2}(NG))^((?!(00)|(CS)).)*$` match rows with `NG` in 3rd and 4th position that do not include `00` or `CS`

`^.{6}(I0)` match rows which contain any 6 characters followed by `IO` in the 7th and 8th position

Putting this together, the following entry extracts results from the result file `ProductionByTechnologyAnnual.csv`, filters out the rows
by matching values in the TECHNOLOGY column with a list of 6 regular expressions (this is an OR operation)
and assigns the unit `PJ/yr` and adds the aggregated (summing over region and year) total under `Primary Energy` in the IAMC template format.

    - iamc_variable: 'Primary Energy'
      primary_technology: ['^.{6}(I0)','^.{6}(X0)','^.{2}(HY)','^.{2}(OC)','^.{2}(SO)','^.{2}(WI)']
      unit: PJ/yr
      osemosys_param: ProductionByTechnologyAnnual
